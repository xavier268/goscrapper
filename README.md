## Introduction

Developping and fine-tuning web-scrappers can be a tedious, error prone task. A lot of repetetive boiler plate code is often needed, and some subtle error checking can easily be forgotten, renderering a hand written scrapper prone to unexpected failures. That where Goscrapper (**gsc** in short) gets in !

**gsc** is a domain specific language designed to write easy to understand, easy to debug, but resilient and reasonnably efficient web scrapping requests.

For instance, the following request is designed to capture up to 3 divs from google, and return an array with the text content of these divs :

````
	page = PAGE "http://www.google.fr" ;        // load google page
	SELECT "div" AS x FROM page LIMIT 3 ;       // select the divs we are interested in
    	RETURN TEXT x ;                         // return the text content for each selected div
                                                // browser is closed, everything is left in a clean state.

````
This request is available among others in the examples folder.

To experiment with this request (and debug it), a small command line utility, named **gsc**, is available :

````
$> .\bin\gsc-0.4.7.exe .\examples\google.gsc
Runtime log : initializing browser ...
[["GmailImages
Connexion
.../...
ParamÃ¨tres"], ["GmailImages
Connexion"], ["GmailImages
Connexion"]]
````

As expected, you got an array of 3 elements, each containing the text content of the first 3 div found on the google home page.

Once you are confident your requests behaves as expected, you obviously want to incorporate it into a golang program. That would be the way to do it in your go code :

````go

import "github.com/xavier268/goscrapper/parser"

// .../...

// get the request source
req := `page = PAGE "http://www.google.fr" ;        // load google page
	    SELECT "div" AS x FROM page LIMIT 3 ;       // select the divs we are interested in
    	RETURN TEXT x ;                             // return the text content for each selected div
                                                    // browser is closed, everything is left in a clean state.`

// compile it, check there is no error.
comp, err := parser.Compile("google test", req)     // the request name is used for information only ...
if err != nil {                                     // check compile errors ...
   // .../...

// create an interpreter to execute the compiled request
int := NewInterpreter(context.Background())         // if the provided context is cancenned, the requests stops immediately

// provide named parameters for the requests, if needed
int = int.With(map[string]any{"password" : "myVerySecretPassword"})

// Execute, and get the result
res, err := int.Eval(comp)

// The same compiled request (comp) can then be reused with a new Interpreter and different input parameters
res2, err := NewInterpreter(context.Background()).With(map[string]any{"password" : "anotherParametr"}).Eval(comp)

````

Note that convenient *function Eval(requestName, requestSource) (any, error)* provides a shortcut when neither customization nor efficiency is critical. The above code becomes :

````go 

// compile, and evaluate in one step.
res, err := parser.Eval("myRequest", req)

````

## Gsc language reference

### Request structure

A request is a list of statements. The last statement should be a single RETURN statement.
Statements are followed by a mandatory semi-colon (;).

Both block  ( /* a block comment */ ) and line comments ( // a line comment ) can appear anywhere in the request. 
Line breaks and spaces are not significant.

All symbols are case-sensitive, reserved keywords are uppercase (eg : SELECT). Some of the keywords can be written using the usual symbols ( eg : PLUS can also be written + ).

### Litteral types

Gsc can directly create litterals for the following types from the request source :

* nil, written as *NIL* or *nil*.
* boolean are written as *false* or *true*.
* numbers are the usual signed integers,
* strings,
* arrays,
* objects.

In addition, the langage itself can produce :

* time.Time (eg : time stamps),
* Page ( html page)
* Element (html Element)
* Hash (a go array, not a slice, of size md5.Size)
  
#### string litterals 

String litterals follow a special syntax, to facilitate escaping. 

String litteral are either written between double quotes (") or between single quotes ('). 

In a string litteral, no caractere is ever escaped (not even "\n"), except for the same quote used to delimit the litteral string. 
Only single quotes need to be escaped in single quote litterals, and only double quotes in double quotes litterals. 

To escape a sequence of one or more quote inside a string, just add one more to the sequence. 
To represent a single quote, write 2. To escape a group of 2 quotes, write 3. 

For instance, *'In this single-quoted string, ''internal'' single quotes need to be escaped but not "double" quotes'.* 

### Variables and scope

A variable name starts with a lower or upper case letter (A-Za-z), followed by zero or more letters and digits (A-Za_z0-9). No other character is allowed. A variable name may not be a gsc [keyword](#reserved-keywords).

Variable values depends on the scope. A new scope is used inside each loop. When retrieving a variable value, the interpreter attemps to return the inner most scope. Prefixing a variable with $ forces the global scope.

A variable prefixed by @ is an input parameter. Reading from a @ variable is actually the only way to declare an input parameter. An input parameter may never be assigned to. No local or glbal variable can be read from or assigned to with the same name as a named parameter.

There is no formal global/local variable declaration, but a variable must *have a chance* to be assigned to before it can be read. 
* A compile time error will happen if a request reads from a variable that had no prior *chance* of being assigned before.
* A runtime error will happen if :
  * assignement is conditionnal, actual runtime assignement may not occur before variable is used, and a runtime error will happen,
  * an input parameter is used, but no value was given to it when launching request execution, a runtime error will happen.

#### Compile time checks on variables

When a source request is compiled, a variable on the left hand side :
* must have a legal name,
* must not be a known named parameter,
* is registered as a declared.

At compile time, a variable on the right hand side :
* must have a legal name,
* if it is prefixed with @ (param),
  *  is rejected if already declared as a global/local variable,
  *  is declared as an named input parameter,
* else,
  *  is rejected if not already seen on a left hand side.

#### Runtime checks on variables

At runtime, a variable on the left hand side :
* may not be a known input parameter,
* can be assigned multiple times, with different values,
* is assigned in the current scope, unless the global specifier ($) is used,

At runtime, a variable on the right hand side :
* returns the specified named parameter if it is an input parameter, (@ is implicit if it was already declared as input parameter)
* returns its current assigned value, reading from the inner most scope, or,
* returns its global scoped value if prefixed with $,
* if no value can be found, return an error.

### Statements

Statements are always followed by a semi -colon.

#### Assignement

a = b ;     // local/global -> local
$a = b ;    // local/global -> global
a = $b ;    // global -> local
a = @c ;    // input param -> local

Assign an expression to a variable. See [variables and scope](#variables-and-scope).

#### RETURN statement

#### IF construct

#### FOR loops

#### SELECT dom elements

#### DOM access
